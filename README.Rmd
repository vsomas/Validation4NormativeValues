# Validation4NormativeValues

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of Validation4NormativeValues is to provide an open source software for the reliability assessment of tabulated normative values.

## Installation

You can install the development version of Validation4NormativeValues from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("vsomas/Validation4NormativeValues")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(Validation4NormativeValues)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r Data}
# NormativeValues from Werle et. al (2009)

Werle_age <-c(
"18-19", "20-24", "25-29", "30-34", "35-39",
"40-44", "45-49", "50-54", "55-59", "60-64",
"65-69", "70-74", "75-79", "80-84", "85+")

agecat <- factor(Werle_age,
                 levels = c("18-19", "20-24", "25-29", "30-34", "35-39",
                            "40-44", "45-49", "50-54", "55-59", "60-64",
                            "65-69", "70-74", "75-79", "80-84", "85+"))

# Values for Females
Werle_females_sample <- c(31, 31, 30, 30, 42, 39, 40, 34, 28, 30, 34, 27, 26, 32, 28)
Werle_females_D_mean_kg <-  c(32.0, 33.4, 34.3, 33.8, 35.8, 34.0, 34.1, 33.7, 31.9,
 28.7, 29.5, 26.4, 25.0, 19.2, 16.9)
Werle_females_D_SD_kg <- c(4.8, 5.4, 5.7, 5.9, 6.7, 6.0, 5.3, 4.5, 4.9, 5.5, 3.6, 6.8,
4.5, 5.2, 4.8)

normWerleFemales <- data.frame(agecat, Werle_females_sample, Werle_females_D_mean_kg, Werle_females_D_SD_kg)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.
